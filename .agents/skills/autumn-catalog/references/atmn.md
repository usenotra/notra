Use `atmn` when a project has or should have an `autumn.config.ts` source of truth.

Commands — these two, not `atmn preview` (that does not exist):

```sh
atmn push          # lints, then previews the diff; applies nothing
atmn push --yes    # apply exactly what the preview showed
```

`push` without `--yes` is always a dry run, on a clean org too, and it never asks anything: `--yes` is the only gate. The commands that do ask (`init`, `login --keyless`, `sandbox use`, `skills install`) print the flag to pass instead whenever there is no TTY, which is every agent run; `--headless` forces that in a terminal.

## When to use it

- New project: run `atmn init`. It connects (sign in, or keyless), places the config, pulls whatever the org already holds, and installs these skills beside it.
- Existing project: if `autumn.config.ts` exists, run `atmn pull` first so every row carries its server ids, then edit and push. Never rewrite a config that predates you from scratch.
- Use MCP/API directly when the user wants dashboard/API-first changes or there is no local config workflow.

## The config is the catalog's state

The document is the whole desired catalog for every collection it states. A plan or feature missing from a stated `plans` / `features` is a deletion (archived when customers depend on it). A collection left out entirely is not managed. That rule reaches down to versions: **a version row missing from `plans` is deleted too**.

Every version of a plan is a row in `plans`. Rows of one plan share a `planId`; each names its version with `versionSlug`; exactly one is `active: true` and the rest `active: false`. There is no history collection and no timeline — array order means nothing. What a version *is* (a group of customers, not a step in time) is the `autumn-concepts` skill's: read `references/plan.md` in the `autumn-concepts` skill. This file owns how rows express it.

Two fields make a row addressable:

- `planId` + `versionSlug` — what you write. The pair names exactly one version. `versionSlug` is required on every plan row and every variant row, including a plan's only version; an omitted slug is a lint error, never an implicit `v1`.
- `internalId` — the server's stable id. It is minted on the first `push --yes` and written back into the fixture; `pull` writes it for every row that lacks one. A fixture carrying it can be renamed (`planId`, `featureId`, `versionSlug`) and the server treats that as a rename, not a delete plus create.

**This is where atmn differs from the API and the dashboard.** Those send one plan entry plus flags — `versioning`, `active`, `propagate` — as `references/catalog-update.md` describes. A config has none of those flags. The intent is read off the rows — which rows exist, which one is active, which carry an `internalId` — and the preview reports what the server derived. If the preview says something other than what you meant, change the rows and preview again; never look for a flag.

| You want | Row edit | Preview shows |
|---|---|---|
| Change a version in place (active or history) | edit that row; keep its `versionSlug` and `internalId` | `~ pro@v1`, a migration for its customers |
| The same change on every version | make the edit on every row of the plan | one `~` per row |
| A new version; customers stay on the old one | add a row: same `planId`, new `versionSlug`, `active: true`, **no `internalId`**; flip the old row to `active: false` | `+ pro@v2`, and `active: true -> false` on the old row |
| A draft nobody can buy yet | add the row with `active: false` beside the active one | `+` with no pointer move |
| Rename the plan id | change `planId` on **every** row of the plan (all carry `internalId`) | a rename, not `-` + `+` |
| Rename a version | change `versionSlug` on a row that carries `internalId` | `Version slug` rename |
| Retire a version | remove its row | `-`; refused while customers are on it (it names both exits: migrate them, or archive the whole plan) |

Guards the lint applies before anything is sent: a plan with no active row or two active rows (`mark the one customers can buy active: true and the rest active: false`), a missing `versionSlug`, the same `planId` + `versionSlug` twice. A plan whose only row is `active: false` is refused — a draft needs an active sibling.

Numbers vs slugs: the server numbers versions in creation order and the preview labels rows with that number (`pro@v2`). The config never states numbers, only slugs. Push a `v1` row after `v2` already exists and the server numbers it higher; the slug still says `v1`. Never read a preview number back as the slug.

## Variants and licenses

What a variant's customize can change, when a base edit reaches a variant, and how a license link anchors to a child version are catalog-wide: `references/catalog-update.md`. What is atmn's:

- A variant is an entry in its base row's `variants` array and a license link an entry in the parent row's `licenses` array: `variant({...})` and `license({...})` fixtures, inline or imported from their own files, edited in place there. Pull writes new ones in that form. Every entry the config lists is a declared overlay; there is no `propagate` in a config, so a base edit reaches a variant through the entry you write, not a follow flag.
- Minting a base version means listing the variant entries again under the new base row, each with the new `versionSlug` and no `internalId`. The old entries stay under the old base row. One variant version cannot serve two base rows; the lint names both rows and says to version and relink the variant.
- To retire a variant, set `archived: true` on its entry. A variant left out of the array is a deletion, refused while customers hold it.
- Every `license({...})` states `versionSlug` — the lint refuses one without it — because the link is pinned to that child version and a config that names it links the same version in every environment. Pull writes it back. Minting a child version moves no parent; relinking a parent is editing that slug.

## Config shapes

`autumn.config.ts` uses the atmn package types, not raw API JSON. Field names are camelCase: `featureId`, `planId`, `billingMethod`, `billingUnits`, `freeTrial`, `intervalCount`, `versionSlug`. Follow the exported types from the package when editing config. Amounts are plain dollars: $20 is `20`, never `2000`.

Builders — `feature`, `plan`, `variant`, `license`. Items are plain objects on the plan; there is no `item()` builder and fixtures expose `featureId` / `planId`, never `.id`. A plan with an active `v2`, its `v1` kept for the customers still on it, each with an annual variant:

```ts
import { atmn, feature, plan, variant } from "atmn";

export const messages = feature({
  featureId: "messages",
  name: "Messages",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const proAnnualV2 = variant({
  variantPlanId: "pro_annual",
  versionSlug: "v2",
  name: "Pro Annual",
  customize: { price: { amount: 250, interval: "year" } },
});

export const proAnnualV1 = variant({
  variantPlanId: "pro_annual",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  name: "Pro Annual",
  customize: { price: { amount: 200, interval: "year" } },
});

export const proV2 = plan({
  planId: "pro",
  versionSlug: "v2",
  active: true,
  name: "Pro",
  price: { amount: 25, interval: "month" },
  items: [{ featureId: messages.featureId, included: 10000, reset: { interval: "month" } }],
  variants: [proAnnualV2],
});

export const proV1 = plan({
  internalId: "prod_…", // written back by push --yes / pull
  planId: "pro",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: false,
  name: "Pro",
  price: { amount: 20, interval: "month" },
  items: [{ featureId: messages.featureId, included: 5000, reset: { interval: "month" } }],
  variants: [proAnnualV1],
});

export default atmn({ features: [messages], plans: [proV2, proV1] });
```

Before `proV2` existed, `proV1` was the active row; minting `v2` was adding `proV2` without an `internalId` and flipping `proV1` to `active: false`.

Usage-priced item:

```ts
{
  featureId: messages.featureId,
  included: 10000,
  reset: { interval: "month" },
  price: {
    amount: 0.9,
    billingMethod: "usage_based",
    billingUnits: 1000,
    interval: "month",
  },
}
```

## Splitting the config

`atmn init` scaffolds four files: `autumn.config.ts` (the root, `export default atmn({...})`), `features.ts`, `plans.ts`, `rewards.ts`. Every version of every plan lives in the `plans` array — active and history rows side by side. The config is ordinary TypeScript, so a row can be lifted into its own file under any export name and referenced from the array; `pull` follows imports and edits each fixture where it lives, and appends rows it has to add to the imported array. What it cannot do is edit a fixture that is not a plain literal — a spread, a helper call, a `.map()` — and it says so and writes nothing rather than guess.

## Update loop

1. Inspect or create `autumn.config.ts`.
2. Edit the config to represent the desired catalog.
3. Run `atmn push` to preview changes.
4. Show the user the plan diffs, the customer impact, which plans mint a new version, and the draft migrations it would create. If the versioning is not what they meant, change the rows (table above) and preview again.
5. Rerun `atmn push --yes` to apply the same preview.
6. Report created/updated/deleted/archived features and plans, and the draft migrations the output lists. `push --yes` also writes `internalId` (and any `versionSlug` the server assigned) back into the fixtures — say so; those edits are expected.

Two notes push prints that are worth relaying: a plan removed while an id-less plan appears looks like a rename — pull first so the fixture carries its id; and a config still stating a deprecated field (`entityFeatureId`) gets a note naming the replacement.

## Pull

`atmn pull` writes the server's catalog back into the config in place: it flips `active` where the dashboard promoted a version, appends versions the config never mentioned, and backfills `internalId` and `versionSlug`. Run it after anyone touches the dashboard, and before editing a config you did not write. With no config yet, `pull` asks which folder to create it in; headless, it prints the `-c <dir>` hint and stops, so run `atmn init` or pass `-c` instead.

`atmn pull --overwrite` is different: it rewrites `autumn.config.ts` and the `features.ts`, `plans.ts` and `rewards.ts` beside it from the server. It never deletes a file, and it leaves alone any file that does not import the package. It needs `--yes`, and it is the right move only when the config describes a different org than the key — the tell is `Your config no longer matches this org's catalog`. Anywhere else, a plain `pull` is what you want.

## Sandboxes and keys

- `atmn sandbox use <name>` pins a named sandbox; every command after it targets that sandbox until `atmn sandbox use --clear`.
- `atmn reset --yes` empties the pinned sandbox; `atmn push --yes` rebuilds it from the config.
- `atmn env --json` says which org, sandbox and key a command would hit, with `notes` on what to do when something is off.
- A missing key fails fast and names the fix: `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY is not set. Run atmn login, or atmn login --keyless if you don't have an account.` — hand that to the setup flow, don't ask the user to paste a key.

## What to show the user

- Which plans mint a new version, and the draft migrations that come with them.
- Feature/plan/version deletions that will archive instead because dependencies or customers exist.
- Which sandbox is pinned before applying anything.
