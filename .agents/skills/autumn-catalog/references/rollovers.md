## Rollovers

Rollovers let unused feature balances carry forward to the next billing cycle instead of being lost at reset. This gives customers more flexibility and prevents wasted allocation.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer on a plan with 1,000 credits/month only uses 600 in January. With rollovers enabled, the remaining 400 credits carry over — giving them 1,400 credits available in February.

## Setting up

Add a `rollover` config to a plan item:

```ts autumn.config.ts
import { atmn, feature, plan } from "atmn";

export const credits = feature({
  featureId: "credits",
  name: "Credits",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const pro = plan({
  planId: "pro",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Pro",
  price: { amount: 20, interval: "month" },
  items: [
    {
      featureId: credits.featureId,
      included: 1000,
      reset: { interval: "month" },
      rollover: {
        max: 2000,
        expiryDurationType: "forever",
        expiryDurationLength: 1,
      },
    },
  ],
});

export default atmn({ features: [credits], plans: [pro] });
```

Preview with `atmn push`, then apply with `atmn push --yes`.

## Rollover configuration

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `max` | Maximum amount that can roll over. Set to `null` for no cap. |
| `expiryDurationType` | `"forever"` (never expires) or `"month"` (expires after N months) |
| `expiryDurationLength` | Number of months until rollover balances expire. Ignored if type is `"forever"`. |

## How rollovers work

At the end of each billing cycle, when a feature's balance resets:

1. Autumn checks how much unused balance remains
2. If rollovers are configured, the unused balance is saved as a **rollover balance**
3. The feature resets to its granted amount, and the rollover is added on top
4. If a `max` cap is set, the oldest rollover balances are trimmed first (FIFO)
5. Expired rollover balances are removed automatically

## Viewing rollover balances

Rollover balances appear in the `breakdown` array when you retrieve a customer's balances. Each rollover entry has its own expiry date:

```json
{
  "balances": {
    "credits": {
      "included_usage": 1400,
      "balance": 1400,
      "usage": 0,
      "breakdown": [
        {
          "plan_id": "pro",
          "included_usage": 1000,
          "balance": 1000,
          "usage": 0,
          "interval": "month",
          "next_reset_at": 1745193600000
        },
        {
          "id": "roll_abc123",
          "included_usage": 400,
          "balance": 400,
          "usage": 0,
          "interval": "one_off",
          "expires_at": null
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Deduction order

Rollovers are deducted **before** a customer's main balances for the same feature. Within the rollover pool, balances are consumed in `expires_at` order: soonest-expiring first, with rollovers that never expire going last. Only once all rollover balances are drained does Autumn fall through to the regular [deduction order](/documentation/concepts/balances#deduction-order) over the main entitlements.

This means carried-over balance is used up before fresh monthly allocation, so rollovers you're about to lose to expiry get spent first.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer has a 1,000 credits/month balance that just reset, plus a 400 credits rollover from last month. They use 300 credits. <br />
> Autumn deducts all 300 from the rollover, leaving 100 credits in rollover and the full 1,000 credits monthly untouched.

Rollovers are only available on `consumable` features with a reset interval. Non-consumable features (like seats) don't reset and therefore don't support rollovers.

## Entity rollovers

If you're using [entity plans](/documentation/modelling-pricing/entity-plans), rollovers are tracked per entity. Each entity's unused balance rolls over independently.
