## Credit Systems

Credit systems let you track actions with different credit costs from a single balance pool.

A credit system is made up of a list of [features](/documentation/concepts/features) that can draw from it, and a credit cost per unit of usage for each feature.

> **Example** <br />
> You have a Pro plan that gives users `100 basic messages` per month, and `10 premium messages` per month. These 2 balances are separate and independent of each other.
> To give your users more flexibility, you instead decide to use a credit system, where:
> - `basic message`: costs 1 credit per message
> - `premium message`: costs 10 credits per message
>
> Instead of having 2 separate balances for each message type, your Pro plan can have `200 credits` per month. Your users can use the credits in any combination of basic and premium messages they want.

## Creating a credit system

  Make sure you have some metered features created before creating a credit
  system.

Define metered features, then create a `credit_system` feature with a `creditSchema` that maps each feature to a credit cost:

```ts autumn.config.ts
import { atmn, feature, plan } from "atmn";

export const basicMessage = feature({
  featureId: "basic_message",
  name: "Basic Message",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const premiumMessage = feature({
  featureId: "premium_message",
  name: "Premium Message",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const credits = feature({
  featureId: "credits",
  name: "Credits",
  type: "credit_system",
  creditSchema: [
    { meteredFeatureId: basicMessage.featureId, creditCost: 1 },
    { meteredFeatureId: premiumMessage.featureId, creditCost: 10 },
  ],
});

export const pro = plan({
  planId: "pro",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Pro",
  price: { amount: 20, interval: "month" },
  items: [
    {
      featureId: credits.featureId,
      included: 200,
      reset: { interval: "month" },
    },
  ],
});

export default atmn({
  features: [basicMessage, premiumMessage, credits],
  plans: [pro],
});
```

Preview with `atmn push`, then apply with `atmn push --yes`.

**Example**

If each `premium_request` is worth 3 credits, then using 6 premium requests will cost 18 credits.

Now you can add this credit system to a plan, such as granting 50 credits per month or charging $1 per credit.

## Tracking and limiting credit usage

When implementing a credit system into your application, **you should interact with the underlying features -- not the credit system itself**. This means passing in the underlying `feature_id` when checking or tracking usage.

#### Checking access

Before allowing a customer to use a feature, `check` if they have enough credits to do so. If each "premium request" is worth 3 credits, then this example will check if the customer has at least 18 credits remaining.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

const response = await autumn.check({
  customerId: "user_123",
  featureId: "premium_request",
  requiredBalance: 6,
});

console.log(response.allowed);
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

response = await autumn.check(
    customer_id="user_123",
    feature_id="premium_request",
    required_balance=6,
)
print(response.allowed)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "feature_id": "premium_request",
    "required_balance": 6
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

The response will contain the balance for the credit system that is being deducted from.

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "customerId": "user_123",
  "requiredBalance": 6,
  "balance": {
    "featureId": "credits",
    "granted": 100,
    "remaining": 100,
    "usage": 0,
    "unlimited": false,
    "overageAllowed": false,
    "nextResetAt": 1757192635393
  }
}
```

In this case, we have a balance of 100 credits remaining, so we're allowed to use our 6 "premium requests" feature.

  If a feature is not defined in the credit system, it will return `allowed: false`

#### Tracking usage

Since the customer has sufficient credits, you can let them use their 6 "premium requests". Afterwards, you can [track](/documentation/customers/tracking-usage) the usage to update their balance.

This will decrement the customer's balance by 18 credits (6 requests * 3 credits per request).

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

await autumn.track({
  customerId: "user_123",
  featureId: "premium_request",
  value: 6,
});
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

await autumn.track(
    customer_id="user_123",
    feature_id="premium_request",
    value=6,
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "feature_id": "premium_request",
    "value": 6
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "customerId": "user_123",
  "value": 6,
  "balance": {
    "featureId": "credits",
    "granted": 100,
    "remaining": 82,
    "usage": 18,
    "unlimited": false,
    "overageAllowed": false,
    "nextResetAt": 1757192635393
  }
}
```

Since the customer started with a balance of 100 credits, and used 18 credits, their remaining balance is 82 credits.

## Rate cards and dimensions

The `creditSchema` is the credit system's **rate card**: one row per metered feature. A row's rate can be flat, graduated by usage, or vary by the properties you send with each event.

### Billing units

`billingUnits` prices a bundle of usage at once: `{ meteredFeatureId: 'tokens', billingUnits: 1000, creditCost: 1 }` charges 1 credit per 1,000 tokens.

### Graduated rates

A graduated row steps the credit cost as usage in the current cycle grows. Tier boundaries are in units and the cost is per `billingUnits`, priced tier by tier: below, the first 10,000 tokens cost 1 credit per 1,000 tokens (10 credits), and everything after costs 0.5 credits per 1,000 tokens.

```ts autumn.config.ts
{
  meteredFeatureId: tokens.featureId,
  billingUnits: 1000,
  tierBehavior: 'graduated',
  tiers: [
    { to: 10_000, creditCost: 1 },
    { to: 'inf', creditCost: 0.5 },
  ],
}
```

The final tier must use `'inf'`, and boundaries must strictly increase.

### Dimensions

A **dimension** is a named alternative rate that applies when an event's `properties` match. Pass the properties on `track` and `check`:

```ts
await autumn.track({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  feature_id: 'actions',
  value: 1,
  properties: { size: 'large', region: 'eu' },
});
```

```ts autumn.config.ts
{
  meteredFeatureId: actions.featureId,
  creditCost: 1,
  dimensions: {
    size_large: { match: { size: 'large' }, creditCost: 16 },
    size_large_region_eu: {
      match: { size: 'large', region: 'eu' },
      creditCost: 20,
    },
    size_xl: {
      match: { size: 'xl' },
      tierBehavior: 'graduated',
      tiers: [
        { to: 5, creditCost: 2 },
        { to: 'inf', creditCost: 1 },
      ],
    },
  },
  multipliers: {
    lifecycle_spot: { match: { lifecycle: 'spot' }, factor: 0.3 },
  },
}
```

How a rate is chosen for an event:

1. The dimension whose `match` has the **most keys** that all match the event wins. `{ size: 'large', region: 'eu' }` beats `{ size: 'large' }`.
2. Ties on key count are broken by `priority` (higher wins). Two dimensions that could both match the same event with the same key count and no priority are rejected when you save.
3. If no dimension matches, the row's own rate applies.
4. **Multipliers** then scale the chosen rate: every matching multiplier's `factor` is multiplied together and every `add` is summed. A multiplier set that could push a rate below zero is rejected at save time.

Property values are compared as strings, so `{ size: 1 }` and `{ size: '1' }` match the same dimension. Dimension names must be at most 64 characters and cannot contain `::`.

Usage is attributed per dimension, so graduated dimensions progress through their own tiers, and invoice credit line items are broken down by feature and dimension.

  A plan item can override its credit system's rate card for customers on that plan via `featureOverride: { creditSchema: [...] }`. The override replaces the rate card entirely, dimensions included.

## Itemized invoice credits

When a plan bills a credit system **pay-per-use at exactly one currency unit per credit** (for example `$1` per credit, or `$100` per 100 credits), Autumn treats the balance as invoice credits: every tracked usage is attributed to the feature that spent it, and the invoice lists one line per feature ("Premium messages, 40 units … $8") plus a "Credits applied" line for the credits the plan included. Balances like this can only be moved by tracked usage and cycle resets, so the invoice always matches the ledger.

Any other price shape (a fractional price per credit, prepaid packs, included-only or pooled items) bills as an ordinary overage. The decision is made per customer when the plan is attached, so changing a plan's price later never rewrites an existing customer's invoices.

  There is no switch to turn this on. The plan item's price decides, so a credit system can itemize on one plan and bill plainly on another.

## Stacking with direct balances

A feature can have both a direct balance **and** belong to a credit system. When this happens, the balances stack and **direct balances are always consumed before credit system balances**, regardless of interval.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer's plan grants `10 premium messages` per month directly, plus `200 credits` per month from a credit system (where each premium message costs 10 credits). <br /><br />
> When the customer sends a premium message, Autumn deducts from the direct premium message balance first. Once those 10 direct messages are used up, subsequent premium messages draw from the credit pool instead.

  The `check` endpoint accounts for both balances. If the customer has 5 direct premium messages remaining plus 100 credits (enough for 10 more premium messages), `check` will report that the customer is allowed.

## Monetary credits

You may want your credit system to represent a monetary value: eg, $10 of credits. To implement this, you can map each credit to a cent value (eg, 1 credit = 1 cent).

1. When creating your credit system, define credit amounts in the per-cent cost

   Eg: if each `premium_request` costs 3 cents, our credit cost should be 3.

2. When adding the credits to a plan, set the granted amount of credits in cents

   Eg, if customers get 5 USD credits for free, they should have an included usage of `500`.

3. When charging for the credits, set the cost of each credit to 1 cent

See the credits pricing guide for a more detailed example of setting up a monetary credits system

## AI Credit Systems

For AI applications that need to track token usage with per-model pricing, you can create an AI credit system. This lets you define markup percentages for each model and automatically calculate costs based on input/output tokens.

Markups are optional. `defaultMarkup` applies to every model unless overridden — by `providerMarkups` (keyed by the first segment of the model ID, e.g. `openrouter`), or by `modelMarkups` for a specific model, which takes highest priority. With no markups set, models are billed at their Models.dev base cost.

A markup of `-100` makes the model free: usage events are still recorded, but nothing is deducted from the balance.

```ts Simplest setup — one markup for everything
export const aiCredits = feature({
  featureId: 'ai_credits',
  name: 'AI Credits',
  type: 'ai_credit_system',
  defaultMarkup: 30, // every model billed at models.dev cost + 30%
});
```

Or mix the levels for finer control:

```ts autumn.config.ts
import { atmn, feature, plan } from "atmn";

export const aiCredits = feature({
  featureId: "ai_credits",
  name: "AI Credits",
  type: "ai_credit_system",
  // Global fallback markup
  defaultMarkup: 30,
  // Per-provider defaults
  providerMarkups: {
    openrouter: { markup: 25 },
  },
  // Per-model overrides (highest priority)
  modelMarkups: {
    "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5": { markup: 20 },
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": { markup: 15 },
    "openai/gpt-4o-mini": { markup: -100 }, // free for customers
    // For custom/self-hosted models, specify input/output costs in $/M tokens
    "custom/my-model": { markup: 25, inputCost: 0.01, outputCost: 0.03 },
  },
});

export const pro = plan({
  planId: "pro",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Pro",
  price: { amount: 50, interval: "month" },
  items: [
    {
      featureId: aiCredits.featureId,
      included: 10, // $10 worth of AI credits
      reset: { interval: "month" },
    },
  ],
});

export default atmn({ features: [aiCredits], plans: [pro] });
```

Preview with `atmn push`, then apply with `atmn push --yes`.

### Model ID Format

Model IDs follow the `provider/model` format:
- Standard models: `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`
- OpenRouter models: `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`
- Custom models: `custom/my-model-name`

For standard models, pricing is automatically fetched from models.dev, including separate rates for cache reads/writes, reasoning, and audio tokens where the model publishes them, plus large-context tier pricing (e.g. above 200k input tokens) when applicable.

For custom models, you must specify both `inputCost` and `outputCost` in dollars per million tokens — tracking fails if either is missing. Custom models bill input and output tokens only; cache, reasoning, and audio pools are ignored.

### Tracking Token Usage

Use the `trackTokens` endpoint to deduct credits based on token usage:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

await autumn.balances.trackTokens({
  customerId: "user_123",
  modelId: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  inputTokens: 1500,
  outputTokens: 500,
});
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

await autumn.balances.track_tokens(
    customer_id="user_123",
    model_id="anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    input_tokens=1500,
    output_tokens=500,
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/balances.track_tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "model_id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    "input_tokens": 1500,
    "output_tokens": 500
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

The cost is calculated automatically based on the model's pricing plus your configured markup percentage.
