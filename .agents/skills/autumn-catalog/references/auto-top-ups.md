## Auto Top-Ups

Auto top-ups automatically purchase additional balance for a customer when their usage drops below a configured threshold. This prevents service interruptions for customers who don't want to manually manage their balance.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer on the Standard plan gets 5,000 credits per month. When their balance drops below 500, Autumn automatically purchases 1,000 more credits at $10 using the plan's one-off prepaid price.

## Prerequisites

Auto top-ups require:
1. A plan with a [one-off prepaid](/documentation/modelling-pricing/one-off-purchases) item for the feature you want to auto top-up
2. The customer must have a saved payment method on file

## Setting up

Auto top-ups are configured per customer, not in `autumn.config.ts`. Your plan needs a one-off prepaid item for the feature you want to auto top-up:

```ts autumn.config.ts
import { atmn, feature, plan } from "atmn";

export const credits = feature({
  featureId: "credits",
  name: "Credits",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const standard = plan({
  planId: "standard",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Standard",
  price: { amount: 50, interval: "month" },
  items: [
    {
      featureId: credits.featureId,
      included: 5000,
      reset: { interval: "month" },
    },
    {
      featureId: credits.featureId,
      price: {
        amount: 10,
        billingUnits: 1000,
        interval: "one_off",
        billingMethod: "prepaid",
      },
    },
  ],
});

export default atmn({ features: [credits], plans: [standard] });
```

The one-off prepaid item (`$10 per 1,000 credits`) is what Autumn uses to replenish the balance. Configure auto top-ups per customer via the API (see below).

## Configuring auto top-ups via API

Set up auto top-ups for a customer by updating their billing controls:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_..." });

await autumn.customers.update({
  customerId: "user_123",
  billingControls: {
    autoTopups: [{
      featureId: "credits",
      enabled: true,
      threshold: 500,
      quantity: 1000,
    }],
  },
});
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_...")

await autumn.customers.update(
    customer_id="user_123",
    billing_controls={
        "auto_topups": [{
            "feature_id": "credits",
            "enabled": True,
            "threshold": 500,
            "quantity": 1000,
        }],
    },
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers/update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "billing_controls": {
      "auto_topups": [{
        "feature_id": "credits",
        "enabled": true,
        "threshold": 500,
        "quantity": 1000
      }]
    }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Auto top-up configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `feature_id` | string | The feature to monitor |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether auto top-up is active |
| `threshold` | number | Balance level that triggers a top-up |
| `quantity` | number | How many units to purchase each time |
| `purchase_limit` | object | Optional limit on how often top-ups can occur |

### Purchase limits

To prevent runaway spending, you can set a purchase limit:

```json
{
  "purchase_limit": {
    "interval": "month",
    "interval_count": 1,
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

This limits the customer to 5 auto top-ups per month. Supported intervals: `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`.

## How it works

1. After every usage event (via `track`), Autumn checks the customer's remaining balance
2. If the balance falls below the configured `threshold`, an auto top-up is triggered
3. Autumn creates an invoice for the configured `quantity` using the one-off prepaid price from the customer's plan
4. The invoice is charged to the customer's saved payment method
5. The balance is replenished with the purchased amount

Auto top-ups use burst suppression to prevent duplicate purchases when multiple track events happen in quick succession. There's a 30-second cooldown between top-ups for the same feature.

## Notifications

Subscribe to the [`billing.auto_topup_succeeded`](/api-reference/webhooks/billingAutoTopupSucceeded) webhook to be notified when a top-up grants credits. The payload includes the granted quantity, the new balance, and the underlying invoice — useful for sending receipts, updating internal ledgers, or reconciling balance after a recharge.

Subscribe to [`billing.auto_topup_failed`](/api-reference/webhooks/billingAutoTopupFailed) to monitor auto top-ups that are blocked, declined, or fail before granting balance. The payload includes a machine-readable `reason` and any available provider error details.

Limit-blocked failure webhooks are suppressed per blocking window to avoid duplicate notifications while the same limit remains active.
