## Add-Ons

Add-ons are plans that can be purchased alongside a customer's existing plan, rather than replacing it. They're used for top-ups, extra feature packs, or supplementary services.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer on the Pro plan can purchase a "Storage Add-On" for an extra 100GB/month, or a one-time "Credit Top-Up" of 500 credits.

## Setting up

Set `addOn: true` on the plan:

```ts autumn.config.ts
import { atmn, feature, plan } from "atmn";

export const storage = feature({
  featureId: "storage",
  name: "Storage (GB)",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: false,
});

export const credits = feature({
  featureId: "credits",
  name: "Credits",
  type: "metered",
  consumable: true,
});

export const storageAddOn = plan({
  planId: "storage_add_on",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Extra Storage",
  addOn: true,
  price: { amount: 5, interval: "month" },
  items: [
    {
      featureId: storage.featureId,
      included: 100,
    },
  ],
});

export const creditTopUp = plan({
  planId: "credit_top_up",
  versionSlug: "v1",
  active: true,
  name: "Credit Top-Up",
  addOn: true,
  items: [
    {
      featureId: credits.featureId,
      price: {
        amount: 10,
        billingUnits: 500,
        billingMethod: "prepaid",
        interval: "one_off",
      },
    },
  ],
});

export default atmn({
  features: [storage, credits],
  plans: [storageAddOn, creditTopUp],
});
```

Preview with `atmn push`, then apply with `atmn push --yes`.

## How add-ons work

Without the add-on flag, attaching a new plan replaces the customer's current plan (within the same [group](/documentation/concepts/plans#plan-properties)). With the add-on flag:

- The plan is **added alongside** the customer's existing plans
- Multiple add-ons can be active at the same time
- Add-ons don't participate in upgrade/downgrade logic

## Balance stacking

When an add-on provides the same feature as the customer's main plan, the balances [stack](/documentation/concepts/balances#balance-stacking). Each source is tracked separately in the `breakdown` array.

> **Example** <br />
> A customer's Pro plan grants 1,000 credits/month. They purchase a one-time top-up of 500 credits. Their total balance is 1,500 credits, tracked as two separate sources.

Autumn uses [deduction order](/documentation/concepts/balances#deduction-order) to consume shorter-interval balances first (monthly before lifetime).

## Purchasing add-ons

Add-ons use the same checkout/attach flow as regular plans:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_..." });

const { data } = await autumn.checkout({
  customer_id: "user_123",
  plan_id: "storage_add_on",
});
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_...")

response = await autumn.checkout(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="storage_add_on",
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/checkout" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "storage_add_on"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

For prepaid add-ons (like a credit top-up), pass the quantity:

```typescript TypeScript
const { data } = await autumn.checkout({
  customer_id: "user_123",
  plan_id: "credit_top_up",
  options: [{
    feature_id: "credits",
    quantity: 1000,
  }],
});
```

## Cancelling add-ons

Cancel an add-on using the same [cancel](/documentation/customers/subscription-lifecycle#cancellations) flow:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
await autumn.cancel({
  customer_id: "user_123",
  plan_id: "storage_add_on",
});
```

```python Python
await autumn.cancel(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="storage_add_on",
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/cancel" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "storage_add_on"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common add-on patterns

| Pattern | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| Recurring add-on | `addOn: true`, recurring price (e.g., $5/month for extra storage) |
| One-time top-up | `addOn: true`, prepaid price, no base price |
| Feature pack | `addOn: true`, grants boolean or metered features |
