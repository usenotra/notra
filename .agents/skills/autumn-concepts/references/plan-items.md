### Plan Item

- Plan Item is the join between a Plan and a Feature.
- It defines what the customer gets for that feature, and whether usage or quantity is billed.
- Plan items turn a Feature into a customer-facing allowance, limit, prepaid package, or overage price.

**Relationships**

- `Plan -> Plan Item`: a plan has many items.
- `Plan Item -> Feature`: `feature_id` identifies the feature being granted or billed.
- `Subscription/Purchase -> Balance`: metered plan items become runtime balances when attached.
- `Subscription/Purchase -> Flag`: boolean plan items become runtime flags when attached.

## Patterns

### Included or unlimited

- Free allowance that comes with the plan.
- For consumable features, `reset` controls the cycle, e.g. 5k credits/month on Pro.
- `unlimited` means the feature is available without a tracked limit.
- For `ai_credit_system` items, `included` and the balance are in dollars (`included: 10` = $10).

### Boolean

- Pass only `feature_id`; set neither `included` nor `unlimited`. `feature_id` alone grants access.
- Grants access rather than quantity.
- Boolean plan items cannot be paid today; charge through `Plan.price` or another metered feature instead.

### Prepaid (consumable)

- Customer buys or subscribes to a consumable quantity upfront, commonly credits.
- Use for selectable monthly buckets, volume-priced buckets, one-off credit packs, and auto top-up purchase prices.
- Selectable monthly bucket example: $10 per 1k credits/month, customer chooses 5k credits for $50/month.
- Volume-priced bucket example: customer selects a monthly credit bucket whose quantity maps to a flat tier price.
- One-off credit pack example: $10 per 1k lifetime credits.
- Auto top-up example: same one-off prepaid item is purchased automatically when customer balance falls below threshold.
- The purchased quantity becomes prepaid balance and is drawn down as usage is tracked.

### Prepaid (non-consumable)

- Customer commits to a persistent quantity upfront, commonly seats or static limits.
- Quantity does not reset each cycle.
- The committed quantity is still charged every billing cycle.
- Can be used as a value the app reads and gates against, even if usage is not tracked.
- Example: concurrency limit of 10, where the app checks the allowed value but does not track consumption.
- Mid-cycle quantity changes can create prorated charges or credits.

### Usage-based (consumable)

- Customer is billed in arrears for usage beyond included units.
- Common for overage, e.g. $0.01/credit after included credits are exhausted.
- Can be tiered, e.g. 1k API calls free, then $0.02/call up to 5k, then $0.01/call after that.

### Usage-based (non-consumable)

- Customer is billed in arrears for measured persistent usage.
- Common for storage or compute capacity tracked through the cycle, e.g. $0.05/GB-month for storage used.
- Usage does not reset like consumable balance, but the billing calculation happens each cycle.
- If the quantity is only a static entitlement like concurrency, do not use usage-based pricing unless the app reports measured usage.

## Tiers

- `price.tiers` set per-bracket pricing; `tier_behavior` is `volume` or graduated (the default).
- Volume (`tier_behavior: "volume"`): tiers are `{ amount: 0, to, flat_amount }`. `to` is the cumulative TOTAL the customer gets at that tier — it includes the item's `included` free amount, not just the paid amount. The whole selected bucket is billed the tier's `flat_amount`.
- Graduated/per-unit: the customer pays `amount` per `billing_units` within each bracket, and `included` free units are added on top of what they buy.

## Composition

- A single item can combine included units with paid usage, e.g. 5k credits/month then $0.01/credit.
- A single item can combine included units with prepaid quantity, e.g. 3 seats included then $10/seat prepaid.
- The same feature can appear in multiple items when the items differ by reset interval or billing method.
- Monthly allowance plus one-off prepaid top-up item is common for auto top-ups.
- Prepaid monthly credit bucket plus usage-based overage item is valid when the same feature needs both selected quantity and overage pricing.
- For per-unit pricing with a base subscription fee, use `Plan.price` for the base fee and a Plan Item for the per-unit feature price.

## Examples

- Included monthly credits:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 5000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "price": null }
  ```
- Usage-based overage after included credits:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 5000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "price": { "amount": 0.01, "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "usage_based" } }
  ```
- Tiered usage-based API calls:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "api_calls", "included": 1000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "price": { "tiers": [{ "to": 5000, "amount": 0.02 }, { "to": "inf", "amount": 0.01 }], "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "usage_based" } }
  ```
  Customer gets 1k calls free, then pays tiered overage at the end of the cycle.
- Base fee plus per-unit seats:
  ```json
  { "plan_price": { "amount": 10, "interval": "month" }, "item": { "feature_id": "seats", "included": 1, "reset": null, "price": { "amount": 10, "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "usage_based" } } }
  ```
  Creates $10/month base price with 1 included seat, then $10 per additional seat.
- Prepaid selectable monthly credit bucket:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 5000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "price": { "amount": 10, "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1000, "billing_method": "prepaid" } }
  ```
  The customer passes `feature_quantities` to choose total monthly credits; quantity includes included units.
- Prepaid volume-priced bucket:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 5000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "price": { "tiers": [{ "to": 31000, "amount": 0, "flat_amount": 250 }, { "to": "inf", "amount": 0, "flat_amount": 10000 }], "tier_behavior": "volume", "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "prepaid" } }
  ```
  Use when the user selects a recurring bucket size and the bucket maps to a flat monthly price.
- One-off prepaid top-up item:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 0, "reset": null, "price": { "amount": 10, "interval": "one_off", "billing_units": 1000, "billing_method": "prepaid" } }
  ```
  Use for credit packs and auto top-ups; auto top-up threshold and quantity live on customer billing controls.
- Prepaid seats:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "seats", "included": 5, "reset": null, "price": { "amount": 10, "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "prepaid" } }
  ```
  Use when the customer commits to a seat quantity upfront; mid-cycle quantity changes can prorate.
- Usage-based storage:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "storage_gb", "included": 100, "reset": null, "price": { "amount": 0.05, "interval": "month", "billing_units": 1, "billing_method": "usage_based" } }
  ```
  Use when persistent usage is measured through the cycle and invoiced in arrears.
- Pooled entity grant:
  ```json
  { "feature_id": "AI_CREDITS", "included": 10000, "reset": { "interval": "month" }, "pooled": true, "price": null }
  ```
  On a plan attached per entity (workspace, project): each entity's 10k joins one shared customer balance that any entity — or the customer directly — can spend. Without `pooled`, each entity keeps its own separate balance.

## Advanced

- `rollover`: for consumable features with reset intervals; unused balance can carry forward subject to cap (absolute `max` or `max_percentage` of the grant) and expiry rules. Rollovers remember the originally granted amount, not just what's left.
- For paid consumable items, `price.interval` determines both the billing cycle and the reset cycle.
- `proration`: mainly relevant to prepaid quantity changes, especially non-consumable or seat-like items.
- `max_purchase`: less common cap on purchasable units; customer billing controls are often used for spend or purchase limits.
- `pooled`: on entity-attached plans, the item's grant joins one shared customer balance instead of a per-entity one (`pooled: true` on the item, in config and API alike). Rollovers on the contributing item carry into the pool. Customer-level purchases (credit packs, overage — often an add-on plan) stack beside the pool and are spendable by all entities. A per-entity cap on a pooled balance is a usage limit (billing control), not a separate balance. Not allowed on license plans.
- `entity_feature_id`: legacy/deprecated per-entity balance scoping; prefer entity-scoped plan attachments. Never mention it unless the user's config already has it.
- Auto top-ups require a one-off prepaid item for the feature; customer billing controls configure threshold and quantity.
- Balances can carry an `expires_at`; expired balances stop counting. Tracked usage can also be windowed (UTC usage windows) for time-boxed caps.
