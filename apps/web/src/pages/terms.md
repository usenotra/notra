## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using Notra ("the Service"), operated by Dominik Koch ("we", "us", or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

The Service includes the website at usenotra.com and the dashboard application at app.usenotra.com.

## 2. Age Restriction

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under 13, you are not permitted to create an account or use the Service in any way. If you are a resident of the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old to consent to the processing of your personal data.

## 3. Subscription and Payment

Notra offers both free and paid subscription plans. Paid subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis (monthly or annually) through our billing provider Autumn (powered by Stripe).

By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis until you cancel. Prices are subject to change, but we will notify you of any price changes before they take effect.

You are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date payment information.

## 4. Cancellation and Refunds

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Upon cancellation, you will retain access to the paid features until the end of your current billing period. No refunds will be issued for partial billing periods.

If you believe you have been charged in error, please contact us at dominik@usenotra.com within 14 days of the charge.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service, including its original content, features, and functionality, is owned by Dominik Koch and is protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

You retain full ownership of any content you create or upload through the Service. Content generated by the AI features of the Service is owned by you upon generation.

## 6. User Representations

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that:

- You have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms
- You will not use the Service for any unlawful purpose

- You will not use the Service to transmit harmful code or malicious content
- The information you provide during registration is accurate and complete
- You have the right to connect any third-party accounts and authorize access to their data

## 7. Content Generation and Data Usage

Notra uses artificial intelligence to generate content based on data from your connected integrations (such as GitHub, Linear, and Slack). By connecting these integrations, you grant us a limited license to access, process, and analyze the data from those services solely for the purpose of generating content on your behalf.

We do not use your connected data to train AI models. Your data is processed in real-time and used exclusively to generate content for your account.

You are responsible for reviewing all AI-generated content before publishing. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of any generated content.

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We do not guarantee any specific level of uptime or availability.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 9. Products and Services

The features, functionality, and pricing of the Service are subject to change at any time. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.

## 10. Contribution License

If you provide us with feedback, suggestions, or ideas regarding the Service, you grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, implement, and incorporate that feedback in any way we see fit, without obligation to you.

## 11. Term and Termination

These Terms remain in effect for as long as you use the Service. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, for any reason, including if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us at dominik@usenotra.com.

## 12. Modifications and Interruptions

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove any part of these Terms at any time. When we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date and may notify you through the Service or via email.

The Service may experience interruptions due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. We are not liable for any loss or inconvenience caused by downtime.

## 13. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), with the seat of arbitration in Hamburg, Germany.

## 14. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Dominik Koch or Notra be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:

- Your use of or inability to use the Service
- Any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and any personal information stored therein
- Any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content generated by the Service
- Any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service

Our total aggregate liability for all claims arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

## 15. Miscellaneous

**Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.

**Assignment:** We may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.

**Waiver:** Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements.
