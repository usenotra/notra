## 1. Privacy Statement

This Privacy Policy describes how Notra ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our website at usenotra.com and our dashboard application at app.usenotra.com (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Your Privacy Rights

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate personal data
- Request deletion of your personal data
- Object to processing of your personal data
- Request restriction of processing your personal data
- Request portability of your personal data

## 3. Age Limit

The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not use the Service. If you are a resident of the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old to consent to the processing of your personal data. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under the applicable age limit, we will take steps to delete that information.

## 4. Cookie Usage

We use only functional and session cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of the Service. These cookies enable core functionality such as authentication and session management.

For analytics, we use [DataBuddy](https://databuddy.cc), a cookie-free, GDPR-compliant analytics service. DataBuddy does not use cookies, does not collect personal data, and does not track individual users across sessions. Because no cookies are used for analytics, no cookie consent banner or opt-out mechanism is required.

We do not use any tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or third-party marketing cookies.

We collect the following types of information:

**Account Data:** When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and profile information provided through OAuth authentication (GitHub or Google).

**Usage Data:** We automatically collect information about how you interact with the Service, including pages visited, features used, and timestamps.

**Content Data:** When you connect third-party integrations (such as GitHub, Linear, or Slack), we collect and process the data you authorize us to access from those services. This includes repository activity, issue data, and messages that you explicitly choose to connect.

**Payment Data:** If you subscribe to a paid plan, payment processing is handled by our billing provider Autumn (powered by Stripe). We do not store your credit card details directly.
